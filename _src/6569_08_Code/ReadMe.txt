There are several plugins provided in this code bundle. They are not meant to be installed simultaneously in your blog as they share filenames and function names. I suggest you install one at a time for testing, and be sure to deactivate and uninstall (i.e. remove completely from your server) each one before trying out another.

Also, if you intend to use the code contained in this code bundle on your Wordpress website, please be sure to rename any plugin folders that you use so that your folder names match the folder names in the chapter.

Below is a listing of the included plugins, listed in the order they are addressed in the chapter.

ahs_doctypes_styles1
This plugin will apply the special style with icons (included in the folder) to all links linking to mp3s, pdfs, docs and zips.

ahs_doctypes_styles2
This plugin works similarly as the first, but it also provides an admin page with the user chooses which document types are to be supported.

ahs_capture_searches1.php
This plugin captures all words searched for on the blog and saves them in a new database table. It also provides a management page where the admin user can view counts of searches for each word.

ahs_searchedwords_widget.php
If the Capture Searched Words plugin is in use, this plugin will display the top X searches, with or without counts, in the sidebar.

ahs_capture_searches2.php
This plugin is the same as the first, but has the Top Searched Words widget included.
