AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION


Welcome to WordPress Complete for 2.7

This is the readme file for the Code Bundle for this book. 

You'll notice that some chapters have multiple sub-folders. Often, in the book, we'll work through a particular example until it is finished. Then in the next section of the chapter we'll add additional functionality to that example. In those cases the example will have two folders, named something like:
example1-simple
example2-fancy

I organized things this way so that you can easily follow along with the code for the simpler version of the example without having to navigate your way through fancy additions that were added later in the chapter.

Be sure to read the readme.txt file in each chapter's code bundle before making use of the code files. Those readme files explain in more detail what each iteration of each example in the code bundle is about.

Happy coding!
